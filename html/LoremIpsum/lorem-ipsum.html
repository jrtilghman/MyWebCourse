            <h2>SA<span id="thirdletter">M</span>UEL L. JACKSON IPSUM</h2>
            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
            <p class='two'>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

            <h2>OBAMA IPSUM</h2>
            <p>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." Because I've seen it.</p>
            <p class='two'>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. It's time for us to change America. You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.</p>
            <p>If you're working forty hours a week, you shouldn't be living in poverty. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. Because I've seen it.</p>

            <h2>BOB ROSS IPSUM</h2>
            <p>You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You can get away with a lot. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. In this world, everything can be happy. It's all a game of angles.</p>
            <p class='two'>Anything you want to do you can do here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>
            <p>Let your heart be your guide. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.</p>
